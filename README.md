# Hydrogen plasma diagnostics
The files set will be a backup for an applied phyiscs project I am doing now (2019 April, maybe till 2020 summer). 
As a collaboration reserach with SRJ.
Basically, I am focusing on the atomic physics. 
Based on the OES system I built (PIMAX4 ICCD, SP2500 seris spectrometer and optical systems such as mirrors and lens),
We are going to measure the H atoms in the EUV produced Hydrogen plasma.
# Files
'temp_h.py' is used for calculating the plasma temperature with line ratio method (H-a & H-b).
'dens_h' is used for calculatiing the the plasma density, Stark and Doppler effects are considered.
'plt.py' is used for plotting the spectrum.
# Acknowledgement 
Thanks for the help from Dr. Tanaka and Dr. Zhu (ILE, Osaka Univ.) during the experiment.
